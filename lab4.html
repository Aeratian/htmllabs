        Albert Einstein is arguably the most influential scientist of the 20th century. His general theory of relativity changed our understanding of space and time, becoming one of the two pillars of modern physics – the other being quantum mechanics. The German-born physicist’s most famous equation, E = mc^2, states that anything with mass has an equivalent amount of energy, and vice versa. It arose from his special theory of relativity, which proposed that in the vacuum of space, the speed of light is always the same, regardless of the movement of the person observing it. It led to a new way of looking at the universe: suggesting that space and time can’t be separated from one another, but rather are interwoven in a continuum. It also suggested that measurements of distance and time both change as you get closer to the speed of light: clocks run slower and lengths appear to get shorter. In the same year, aged just 26, he developed three other ground-breaking theories – on Brownian motion, mass-energy equivalence, and the law of the photoelectric effect, for which he went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1921. - Donna Lu (<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/people/albert-einstein/">Source</a>)
