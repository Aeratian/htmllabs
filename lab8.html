    <p>South Korea is a country located in the eastern region of Asia. The country is located on the Korean peninsula, bordering North Korea to the north. On the border, there is a demilitarized zone with military personnel from both North and South Korea guarding, which prevents people from crossing. This is commonly known as the 38th parallel.</p>
    <p>Some major landforms include the Taebaek Mountains to the northeast, the Han River, which runs through the capital, and the Nakdong River, which is the longest river. The winters are often very cold and dry, while the summers are hot and humid. Korea is a mostly homogenous country with a foreign population of only 2.3%. Notable religions include Buddhism and Christianity. However, most Koreans hold atheist beliefs. The country is currently capitalistic and holds one of the largest economies in the world. The national currency is the won, which is worth about 0.1 cents. Korea is also run under a democracy with two prominent parties.</p>

    <p>
      I am interested in this country because I am born to South Korean parents. I would like to learn more about my cultural heritage as I have only seldom visited South Korea. Additionally, I am very interested in Korean music and entertainment, making me want to learn more about the culture.
