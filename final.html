		    <h2>Sightseeing</h2>
			<p>There are countless breathtaking attractions in Texas due to its significance in America's history.</p> <hr>
			<p>
			   One of the most famous attractions is the Alamo, which is a mission located in San Antonio, Texas. The mission is one of the major historic sites of the fight for Texan independence from Mexico. 
			   In the Battle of the Alamo, Texans posed a valient defense against Mexican forces and the Alamo became a symbol for Texan independence. In a later battle, the battle cry <q>Remember the Alamo!</q> became the main one for Texan soldiers.
			   Today, visitors can see the restored version of the Texan chapel. The site has also been converted into a museum, where visitors can experience this event that was so integral to US history. In 2015, the Alamo was later declared a UNESCO World Heritage site, solidifying the Alamo as a historical site you don't want to miss. <br>

			<p>A major sightseeing location for science lovers is the NASA Johnson Space Center. The spaceflight research facility was originally built to expand the Apollo experiment during the Space Race
			   of the Cold War. Today, it continues to be one of the largest space bases in the United States, being the home for training astronauts for human space flight. Although it is still used for space research today, part of the space center has been converted to a museum, 
			   called the Space Center Houston, where visitors can learn about astronomy and the history of NASA in America. The museum is home to over 400 different space artifacts and hosts various exhibits and shows about human space flight history. It contains the only replica of the Space Shuttle and has recently opened an exhibit on human life on Mars. The center also hosts STEM workshops for students and adults interested in expanding

		    <h2>Food</h2>
			<p>Barbeque has become a staple in Texas in recent years. Famous for its large portions and beef-based barbeque, Texas is a must-go place for any meat lover. When one thinks of Texas barbeque, we typically think of the style prevalent in Central Texas.
			   Beef brisket is one of the staple dishes of Texas barbeque with two different styles: moist, which contains fat and more flavor, and lean, which is healthier. Other than brisket, Texas has a wide variety of slow-smoked pulled pork and ribs present at almost every
			   major festival. Sausages are another major dish in Texas barbeque as the countless varieties combine flavors from all over the world. However, lines for barbeque can span up to two hours, so be prepared to wait a considerable amount if one is looking to get a taste of authentic Texas BBQ.
